This is the Sparse Grids module of the TASMANIAN project

QuickBuild: try typing "make" and see what happens, you need g++ installed

Possible Issues:
- some Mac users have errors when running the code with gcc 4.4 and OpenMP enabled, either upgrade gcc to a newer version or disable OpenMP in the makefile 
(i.e. remove "-fopenmp" from the COMPILE_OPTIONS)
